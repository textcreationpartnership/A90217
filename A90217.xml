            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

His Master <hi>Oliver</hi> came not in such pride and state, nor sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to his Dinner at <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> as this one-eyed Varlet marcht with insolence and fury to the Exchange to a butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and with the same quarrel against the Prentices, as his Comrade <hi>Tom Pride</hi> had against the Beares, meerly for their Skins. He hath formerly been a <hi>Tory-hunter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and imagined he had then bin on such an expedition, for he skipt and danced over the kennels, as if they had bin bogs, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued his enterprise as closly as ever his cobling ends did his Awle. Hold up his Dagger-hand, lets see whether the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have not puncht him, and given him an earnest in his fist for a Halter. Bring him to the Barre of the other House, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168762:3"/> let him be tryed by his Peers, and see if 12 such Cobaliros can be found among all the Anabaptist Churches that have most of the Trade in Saintship with them; may he have and be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a size of twelves, such Godfathers as the turn will afford him, though there be no heed now adayes to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer in that, yet let regard be had to the common cry of the City. Was the black Rod do you think, ever intended or designed to whip Coblers? or will Princes Robes sit hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som on Brewers backs, and yet this goodman two shoes, by a relish and smack of Lordly Dignity, did confidently personate that pretended Honour, and acted not barely as a Lord in his late Riot and Tumult, but usurped the Authority and Power as if he had been our Lord Mayor.</p>
            <p>We never yet heard of any that assended from his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to that pitch and height of Magistracy; but we now see the difference betwixt a company of Cordwainers and a company of Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

            <p>But though the Jewish Law forbids any imperfect Sacrifice to be offered, yet we will not rest nor cease our prosecution, till we have sacrificed this blind Cobler to the Ghosts of our slain, and to the injuries of our wounded Brethren, and in satisfaction of the Outrages and affronts he hath done to us.</p>

That after he hath humbled himself a moneth, he be sent into the City of <hi>London,</hi> and there to stand in the Pillory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he hath had as many rotten Eggs flung at him, as he hath sowed stitches in Shooes or Boots; and then to be taken down, and tyed to a Cart, and whipped from thence to the place where the Speaker's Coach was stopped, and had stones cast at him by the Souldiery, there to be again Pillorized, and bored through the Tongue for his wicked perjuries.</p>

            <p>First, Because they say he was a Knight, we will degrade him of his new gentility, by throwing a Basket of grains in his eye, and pull off his Spurs; and having stript him out of his breeches, give him a hundred blowes on his bare breech with his Coloshoes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his brustling in our streetts, we will with his Awles pierce his hide all over, and put Bristles in the holes, as the old Womans Arse that was stuft with Parsley.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The one good eye he hath left, wee'l take out of his Head, and bestow it upon blind <hi>Milton,</hi> that it may still be worn as an Ornament in a knaves countenance, and when he leaves it, it shall be given to Surgeons Hall for a rarity.</p>

We will pick his bones clear, and tip them with the Iron of his Sword, and make Ninepins of them, and in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of <hi>Skimmington,</hi> they shall be carried in procession, and be reverenced by the scolds of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
